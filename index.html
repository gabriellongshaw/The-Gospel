      <div class="story-content">
        <p>The birth of Jesus is the beginning of the story of our salvation, fulfilling centuries of prophecy. The prophet Isaiah foretold of a child to be born who would be called <p class="story-verse">"Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace" (Isaiah 9:6).</p> The story begins with an angel appearing to a young virgin named Mary in Nazareth, telling her she would conceive by the Holy Spirit.</p>
        <p class="story-verse">Luke 1:30-33 (NKJV): “Then the angel said to her, ‘Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son, and shall call His name JESUS. He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David. And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there will be no end.’”</p>
        <p>Mary and her husband Joseph traveled to Bethlehem to register for a census. Because there was no room for them in the inn, Mary gave birth to Jesus in a humble stable, laying Him in a manger. Shepherds were the first to hear the good news from a host of angels and rushed to see the child. Later, wise men from the East followed a star to worship Him and brought gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</p>
        <p class="story-verse">Matthew 2:10-11 (NKJV): “When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy. And when they had come into the house, they saw the young Child with Mary His mother, and fell down and worshiped Him. And when they had opened their treasures, they presented gifts to Him: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.”</p>
        <p>This humble beginning shows Jesus’ humanity and His mission to serve all people, regardless of status, while fulfilling God’s promises from the Old Testament.</p>

      <div class="story-content">
        <p>The crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ are central to the Christian faith. Jesus taught, healed, and performed miracles over three years. Betrayed by Judas, He was arrested, put on trial, and sentenced to death by crucifixion. Jesus willingly gave His life on the cross as a sacrifice for the sins of humanity.</p>
        <p class="story-verse">Romans 5:8 (NKJV): “But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.”</p>
        <p>After His death, Jesus’ body was placed in a tomb guarded by Roman soldiers. On the third day, the tomb was found empty, and angels declared that He had risen. Jesus appeared to His disciples and more than 500 people over 40 days, proving He had conquered death.</p>
        <p class="story-verse">1 Peter 1:3 (NKJV): “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His abundant mercy has begotten us again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.”</p>
        <p>The resurrection assures believers of eternal life, forgiveness, and the hope of victory over sin and death.</p>

        <p>In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus tells of a younger son who asks for his inheritance, leaves home, and squanders his wealth in reckless living. When a famine strikes, he finds himself destitute and caring for pigs, realizing the gravity of his mistakes.</p>
        <p class="story-verse">Luke 15:20 (NKJV): “And he arose and came to his father. But when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.”</p>
        <p>The son returns home to seek forgiveness. The father welcomes him with love, mercy, and a celebration, showing the power of repentance and God’s unconditional love. The story illustrates God’s forgiveness and the joy in heaven over one sinner who repents.</p>
        <p>This parable reminds believers that no matter how far they stray, God’s grace is available, and reconciliation is always possible.</p>

        <p>Jesus tells the story of a man traveling from Jerusalem to Jericho who is attacked by robbers. A priest and a Levite see him but pass by. Then, a Samaritan—considered an outsider by Jews—tends to the man’s wounds, brings him to an inn, and ensures his care.</p>
       <p class="story-verse">Luke 10:36-37 (NKJV): “So which of these three do you think was neighbor to him who fell among the thieves? And he said, ‘He who showed mercy on him.’ Then Jesus said to him, ‘Go and do likewise.’”</p>
        <p>The story teaches that love for neighbor transcends ethnicity, religion, and social boundaries. True compassion requires action, selflessness, and mercy toward anyone in need.</p>
        <p>It is a call for believers to embody God’s love through practical care and empathy in daily life.</p>
