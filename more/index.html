          <h3>What is the Gospel?</h3>
          <p>The Gospel means <strong>"good news."</strong> It is the central message that God loved the world so much that He sent His Son, <strong>Jesus Christ</strong>, who lived a perfect life, willingly died on the cross for our sins, and rose again on the third day. This sacrifice secured <strong>forgiveness and eternal life</strong> for all who place their faith in Him.</p>

          <h3>How do I become a Christian?</h3>
          <p>Becoming a Christian is a <strong>gift</strong> received through faith, as <strong>Ephesians 2:8 (NKJV)</strong> states: <strong>"For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God."</strong> This faith involves personally believing on Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior). As <strong>Romans 10:9 (NKJV)</strong> states: <strong>"that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved."</strong></p>

          <h3>Where to start reading the Bible</h3>
          <p>We recommend starting with the <strong>Gospel of John</strong>. It provides a clear and powerful account of <strong>Jesus' identity, life, miracles, and purpose</strong> - an excellent foundation for newcomers to the faith. You might follow this with the Gospel of Mark (the shortest gospel) or the Book of Romans (which explains Christian doctrine).</p>

          <h3>What should I do after becoming a Christian?</h3>
          <p>The next steps are essential for spiritual growth: <strong>Pray</strong> (talking to God daily), <strong>Read the Bible</strong> (studying God's Word regularly), find a trustworthy <strong>local church</strong> to join for fellowship and teaching, and <strong>share the good news</strong> with others.</p>

          <h3>Is there a specific prayer I need to pray?</h3>
          <p>There's no required or "magic" formula. Salvation comes from a genuine heart change, not mere words. A sincere prayer of <strong>repentance and faith</strong> is all that's needed. For example: "Dear God, I know I'm a sinner. I believe Jesus died for my sins and rose again. I choose to follow Him as my Lord and Savior. Amen."</p>

          <h3>Why do Christians go to church?</h3>
          <p>The local church is a body of believers where we <strong>worship God together,</strong> are taught from the Bible through preaching, practice <strong>communion and baptism</strong>, and <strong>encourage one another</strong> in our shared faith journey, as instructed in Hebrews 10:24-25.</p>
